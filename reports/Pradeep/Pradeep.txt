Fundamentals (Array)      x86         x60-80          🟢 ABOVE AVG
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 STRENGTHS:
  ✓ Solid problem count (201 is respectable for backend dev)
  ✓ Language consistency (87.5% Java matches resume perfectly)
  ✓ Good fundamental coverage (Arrays x86, Strings x53, Hash Table x37)
  ✓ Advanced topics exposure (DP x23, Backtracking x11)
  ✓ Demonstrated commitment in 2023 (171 active days, 100 days badge)
  ✓ Appropriate for interview prep focus (not competitive programming)
  ✓ No signs of cheating or plagiarism (natural activity pattern)

🎯 WEAKNESSES:
  ⚠️ Activity cliff post-employment (93% reduction from peak)
  ⚠️ Skills likely rusty (only 12 active days in 2025)
  ⚠️ Low Hard problem count (only 10, needs 20-30)
  ⚠️ No contest experience (limits problem-solving under pressure)
  ⚠️ Below-average acceptance rate (56% vs 60-70% benchmark)
  ⚠️ Not maintaining skills (stopped learning after getting job)

VERDICT: 
Pradeep has a DECENT LeetCode profile for a 2-year backend developer focused
on interview preparation. He demonstrated strong commitment during 2023 (171
active days, 100 Days Badge), solving 201 problems with good coverage of
fundamentals and advanced topics (DP, Backtracking).

HOWEVER, the significant activity cliff after 2023 is concerning. He went
from 171 active days (2023) → 28 days (2024) → 12 days (2025), suggesting
he stopped practicing once employed. This is common but not ideal.

His Java-heavy approach (176/201 problems) perfectly aligns with his resume
and GitHub profile, which is a strong authenticity signal.

SCORE JUSTIFICATION: 6.8/10
• Would be 7.5-8.0/10 if he maintained consistent practice in 2024-2025
• Would be 8.5-9.0/10 if he had contest participation and higher Hard count
• Current score reflects: Good foundation but declining engagement

RECOMMENDATION FOR RECRUITERS:
If hiring Pradeep, expect he may need 2-4 weeks to refresh his DSA skills
before performing well in technical interviews. He has the foundation but
needs practice to be interview-ready for companies with rigorous coding
rounds. For startups with less algorithmic interviews, he's ready as-is.

🔮 FUTURE TRAJECTORY PREDICTION
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE (Feb 2026): 2 YOE, SDE-1, Credibility 7.5/10

SCENARIO 1: Maintains Current Path (No Portfolio Improvement)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Timeline    Role Level    Salary Range       Credibility
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2027        SDE-2         ₹14-18 LPA         7.5/10 (stagnant)
2028        SDE-2/Senior  ₹18-22 LPA         7.5/10 (limited growth)
2030        Senior SDE    ₹25-30 LPA         8.0/10

Path: Steady but slow. Will be seen as "good developer" but not standout.
Risk: Harder to switch to top-tier companies without public portfolio.

SCENARIO 2: Implements Growth Recommendations (Active Portfolio Building)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Timeline    Role Level    Salary Range       Credibility
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Mid-2026    SDE-1         ₹12-15 LPA         8.5/10 (with showcase)
2027        SDE-2         ₹18-24 LPA         9.0/10
2028        Senior SDE    ₹28-35 LPA         9.2/10
2030        Staff/Lead    ₹40-50 LPA         9.5/10

Path: Accelerated growth. Becomes visible to top companies and recruiters.
Strategy: Public portfolio + fintech specialization = unique positioning.

RECOMMENDED PATH: SCENARIO 2

Why? Because Pradeep already has the EXPERIENCE and SKILLS. He just needs
to make them VISIBLE. The gap is not in ability - it's in showcase.

Action Plan:
• Next 3 months: Build public portfolio (GitHub + LeetCode + Portfolio site)
• Next 6 months: System design maturity + AWS certification
• Next 12 months: Position as "Fintech Backend Specialist" with proven track record
• By 2027: Target SDE-2 roles at Razorpay, PhonePe, CRED, or Series B+ startups

CEILING POTENTIAL:
With current trajectory: Senior SDE at mid-tier company (₹30-35 LPA by 2030)
With optimized growth: Staff Engineer at top fintech (₹50-60 LPA by 2030)

The difference? VISIBILITY + SPECIALIZATION + CONTINUED LEARNING
