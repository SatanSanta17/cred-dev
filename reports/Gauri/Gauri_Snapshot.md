## ⚠️ CONCERNS & WEAKNESSES

### 1. RESUME-LINKEDIN INCONSISTENCIES (MAJOR)
**6 Critical Discrepancies Detected:**
- Campus location unclear (Vellore vs Bhopal - impacts tier assessment)
- Internship on LinkedIn but missing from resume (red flag for accuracy)
- 3 of 4 leadership roles unverified (FeedBox, Blockchain, Cultural Club)
- Title discrepancy (Lead vs Coordinator)
- Project name mismatch (Podstream vs thyPodcast)
- Certification platform inconsistencies

**Impact:** Questions accuracy and truthfulness of claims

### 2. LIMITED PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
- Only **1 internship:** Codveda Technologies (2 months, Feb-Mar 2025)
- **Missing from resume** (major concern)
- All other projects are academic/personal
- Will need on-the-job training and mentorship
- No production code experience

### 3. UNVERIFIED LEADERSHIP CLAIMS
**Resume Claims vs LinkedIn Reality:**
- FeedBox Club | General Secretary → NOT found on LinkedIn
- Blockchain Club | Content Team Lead (11 members) → NOT found on LinkedIn
- Cultural Club | Event Team → NOT found on LinkedIn
- E-Cell | Event Team Lead → LinkedIn shows "Event Coordinator" (title mismatch)

**All impact metrics unverified:** "25% efficiency", "1000+ participants", "5,000+ attendees"

### 4. NO CONTEST PARTICIPATION
- Zero LeetCode contest rating
- Could indicate: avoiding timed pressure tests OR just practice-focused
- Combined with other discrepancies, reduces confidence

### 5. MINIMAL GITHUB PRESENCE
- Account created May 2024 (only 8 months old)
- 0 followers, 0 following (no community building)
- No open-source contributions
- No detailed READMEs (limits project depth assessment)
