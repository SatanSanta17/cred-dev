# CREDDEV REPORT GUIDELINES — V2

### (Skill Intelligence Engine Model)

## 0. Core Philosophy

CredDev does not analyze platforms.
CredDev analyzes **capability**.

Platforms are evidence.
Skills are truth.

The goal of CredDev is to interpret a developer’s real-world readiness by synthesizing signals across:

* engineering activity
* problem solving behavior
* professional credibility
* execution patterns

All outputs must originate from a **single intelligence core**.

We do not write multiple reports.
We generate multiple views from one intelligence model.

---

# 1. Report Architecture (NEW)

## Stage 1 — Intelligence Core (Primary)

This is the ONLY report written manually.

This layer is:

* internal
* extensive
* evidence-heavy
* interpretation-first

It contains:

* raw signals
* cross-platform correlations
* capability interpretation
* credibility checks
* benchmark positioning

This is the source of truth.

Everything else derives from this.

---

## Stage 2 — Derived Views (Generated)

From the intelligence core, we generate:

### A) Developer Insight View

Focus:

* growth direction
* role positioning
* improvement levers
* career clarity

Tone:
supportive, directional.

---

### B) Recruiter Insight View

Focus:

* screening clarity
* verification
* interview readiness
* risk & reliability

Tone:
operational, decision-oriented.

---

### C) Credibility Card (future)

Not a report.

Generated from:

* identity positioning
* percentile
* strengths

Used for:

* social presence
* visibility
* signaling

---

# 2. Skill Domain Model (Primary Analysis Framework)

All analysis must be mapped to these domains.

NOT platforms.

---

## Domain 1 — Engineering & Development

Signals interpreted:

* architecture thinking
* production exposure
* system maturity
* deployment awareness
* code ownership
* real-world build capability

Evidence sources:

* GitHub
* work projects
* system design exposure
* deployment history
* OSS contribution

GitHub = evidence
Engineering depth = interpretation

---

## Domain 2 — Problem Solving & Algorithms

Signals interpreted:

* algorithmic thinking
* debugging discipline
* complexity awareness
* pattern recognition
* interview readiness

Evidence sources:

* LeetCode
* Codeforces
* HackerRank
* problem-solving repos

LeetCode = evidence
Problem-solving ability = interpretation

---

## Domain 3 — Professional Credibility

Signals interpreted:

* claim reliability
* career consistency
* role clarity
* professional presence
* collaboration footprint

Evidence sources:

* LinkedIn
* resume
* internships
* certifications
* recommendations

LinkedIn = evidence
Credibility = interpretation

---

## Domain 4 — Execution & Consistency

Signals interpreted:

* long-term discipline
* learning velocity
* persistence
* engagement patterns

Evidence sources:

* GitHub activity
* LC heatmaps
* certifications timeline
* project evolution

Activity = evidence
Execution maturity = interpretation

---

# 3. Credibility Evaluation Rules

CredDev is a verification layer, not a judge.

Every claim must be tagged as:

* VERIFIED → supported by observable evidence
* PLAUSIBLE → consistent but not fully verifiable
* CLAIMED → stated but not evidenced

Never assume.

Never accuse.

Frame as:

* signal alignment
* verification pending
* claim mismatch

Not:

* fraud
* exaggeration
* fake

Tone defines trust.

---

# 4. Interpretation Principles

## Do NOT describe data.

Interpret capability.

Wrong:
“200 commits”

Correct:
“Consistent production engagement signal”

---

## Convert platform signals into skill language.

Wrong:
“LeetCode strong”

Correct:
“High algorithmic discipline with medium-depth problem exposure”

---

## Always answer:

What does this mean for:

* hiring
* growth
* positioning

Not:
what happened.

---

# 5. Benchmarking Framework

Every major evaluation must answer:

Compared to whom?

Use:

* early career backend pool
* fresher engineering pool
* fintech backend pool
* problem-solving prep cohort

Benchmarking converts:

analysis → decision intelligence.

---

# 6. Tone Discipline

CredDev must feel:

* neutral
* observant
* evidence-driven
* mature

Avoid:

* hype
* judgement
* harsh language
* motivational fluff

This is not:

career coaching content.

This is:

capability interpretation.

---

# 7. Identity Formation

Every intelligence core must produce:

### Capability Identity Line

One sentence:

Defines:

* role
* readiness
* maturity
* specialization

Example:

“Production-oriented backend engineer with strong fintech exposure and moderate algorithmic depth.”

This identity powers:

* recruiter view
* dev view
* credibility card

---

# 8. Red Flag Handling

Red flags must be framed as:

* signal inconsistencies
* verification gaps
* maturity risks

Never:

* accusations
* conclusions

CredDev is:

diagnostic.

Not investigative.

---

# 9. Output Responsibility

Remember:

We are not writing:

reports.

We are building:

skill intelligence.

Developer insights and recruiter insights must emerge from the same intelligence core — not separate opinions.

---

# 10. Guiding Principle

If platforms disappear tomorrow…

CredDev should still be able to answer:

* what this person can build
* how they solve problems
* whether they can be trusted
* what role suits them

That is the standard.
