## ⚡ Quick Verification Checklist

### 1️⃣ LANGUAGE AUDIT (30 seconds)

Search report for these words. If found, verify they have proof:

- [ ] "expertise" → Replace with "experience" unless 5+ years OR recognized achievement
- [ ] "specialization" → Replace with "focus" unless 5+ years OR certification
- [ ] "expert" → Replace with "experienced" unless industry recognition
- [ ] "strong" → Replace with "adequate/within range" unless data proves top 20%
- [ ] "solid" → Replace with "appropriate" unless above average
- [ ] "excellent" → Replace with "good" unless top 5% with proof
- [ ] "deep knowledge" → Replace with "working knowledge" unless 5+ years
- [ ] "advanced" → Replace with "intermediate" unless certified OR hard problem solver
- [ ] "proven track record" → Replace with "work history shows" unless multiple verified projects
- [ ] "mastery" → Remove unless clear proof (certifications, competitions)

---

### 2️⃣ VERIFICATION TIER CHECK (1 minute)

For each major claim in report:

- [ ] ✅ **VERIFIED** = Can independently confirm (LeetCode stats, GitHub count, LinkedIn dates)
- [ ] 🟡 **PLAUSIBLE** = Aligns with context but can't confirm (project at verified company)
- [ ] ⚠️ **CLAIMED** = Resume metric that can't be verified (percentages, impact claims)

**If CLAIMED, must have disclaimer:**
```
⚠️ NOTE: [Metric] is candidate's claim. Cannot be independently 
verified without access to [source]. [Realistic range comment if applicable]
```

---

### 3️⃣ MANDATORY DISCLAIMERS (2 minutes)

Check report has disclaimers for:

- [ ] Any percentage claim ("70% reduction", "40% improvement")
- [ ] Any impact metric ("10M requests/day", "saved $X")
- [ ] Any team size claim ("led team of X")
- [ ] Any private/inaccessible profile (LeetCode private, GitHub private)
- [ ] Any skill listed but not demonstrated ("listed but not shown in public work")

---

### 4️⃣ NO ASSUMPTIONS RULE (1 minute)

Search for assumption phrases. Replace if found:

- [ ] "likely" → State "data not available" instead
- [ ] "probably" → State "cannot verify" instead  
- [ ] "assumed" → State "insufficient data" instead
- [ ] "estimated" → State actual data or "cannot determine" instead
- [ ] "appears to be" → State what IS confirmed, not what appears

---

### 5️⃣ CROSS-PLATFORM CONSISTENCY (2 minutes)

- [ ] Timeline verified across LinkedIn/Resume/GitHub/LeetCode
- [ ] Skills match across platforms (Java in resume = Java in GitHub/LeetCode?)
- [ ] Location consistent across profiles
- [ ] Experience years accurate (calculate from actual dates, not resume claim)
- [ ] No contradictions between sources

---

### 6️⃣ RED FLAGS CHECKED (2 minutes)

- [ ] No timeline fraud (experience vs activity age)
- [ ] No bulk commits (100+ commits in one day)
- [ ] No fork-only GitHub (all repos forked, none modified)
- [ ] No LeetCode cramming (all problems in 1-2 weeks suspiciously)
- [ ] No fake companies (all employers verified)
- [ ] No diploma mills (education institutions verified)
- [ ] No inflated titles ("Senior" at 1 YOE)

---

### 7️⃣ SCORE JUSTIFICATION (1 minute)

For each score, verify report includes:

- [ ] Specific data points used
- [ ] Benchmark comparison ("compared to X average")
- [ ] What would improve the score
- [ ] Why not higher/lower

Example: ✅ "6.8/10 based on 201 problems (avg: 150-300 for 2 YOE). Would be 8.0/10 with 300+ problems and 65% acceptance rate."

---

### 8️⃣ FACTUAL SUMMARY CHECK (30 seconds)

Opening summary must be:

- [ ] Factual (no marketing language)
- [ ] Specific (actual role, actual years, actual focus)
- [ ] Honest (includes gaps or concerns if significant)
- [ ] Neutral tone (not selling, not criticizing)

❌ BAD: "Exceptional backend expert with strong expertise in microservices"
✅ GOOD: "Backend developer with 2 years experience working primarily in Java Spring Boot"

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL STOPS

**DO NOT submit report if:**

1. ❌ Any percentage/impact metric lacks ⚠️ NOTE disclaimer
2. ❌ Uses "expertise/expert/mastery" without clear proof
3. ❌ Makes assumptions instead of stating data limitations
4. ❌ Has contradictions in timeline/skills across platforms
5. ❌ Scores lack clear data-based justification

---

## ✅ GREEN LIGHT INDICATORS

**Report is ready if:**

1. ✅ All claims marked as VERIFIED, PLAUSIBLE, or CLAIMED
2. ✅ Disclaimers present for all unverifiable metrics
3. ✅ Language is neutral and fact-based
4. ✅ No assumptions presented as facts
5. ✅ Cross-platform consistency verified
6. ✅ Scores justified with specific data
7. ✅ Red flags section complete (even if "None detected")
8. ✅ Data limitations clearly stated

## 📊 Score Sanity Check

| Score | Must Have | Red Flags If |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **9.0+** | Multiple platforms verified, public showcase, no red flags | Single platform only, no public work |
| **8.0-8.9** | Good verification, above average metrics | Below average metrics given score |
| **7.0-7.9** | Adequate verification, average+ performance | Unverified claims treated as fact |
| **6.0-6.9** | Basic verification, average performance | Major gaps not acknowledged |
| **<6.0** | Limited verification OR red flags present | Given high score despite issues |

---

## 🎯 Final Question Before Submit
