# CREDDEV REPORT CHECKLIST — V2

### (Skill Intelligence Engine Workflow)

This checklist is about building structured capability intelligence.

---

# STAGE 0 — INPUT COLLECTION

Before analysis begins, confirm:

### Required Inputs

* [ ] Resume (latest version)
* [ ] GitHub profile
* [ ] LeetCode / CP profile
* [ ] LinkedIn profile

Optional but valuable:

* [ ] Portfolio
* [ ] Blog / Medium
* [ ] Open source contributions
* [ ] Certifications proof links

If any input is missing:

* [ ] Clearly log as “data limitation”
* [ ] Do NOT estimate performance

---

# STAGE 1 — RAW SIGNAL EXTRACTION

Do NOT interpret yet.

Just extract observable signals.

---

## 1A — Engineering Evidence Extraction

From GitHub / projects:

* [ ] Total repos
* [ ] Original vs fork ratio
* [ ] Commit frequency pattern (consistent vs burst)
* [ ] Language distribution
* [ ] Presence of backend/frontend/system code
* [ ] Readme quality
* [ ] Signs of production thinking (env files, configs, docker, CI)
* [ ] Architecture indicators (microservices? monolith?)
* [ ] Depth of largest project
* [ ] Code complexity level (basic CRUD vs multi-service)

Do NOT score yet.

---

## 1B — Problem Solving Evidence Extraction

From LeetCode / CP:

* [ ] Total solved
* [ ] Easy/Medium/Hard ratio
* [ ] Acceptance rate
* [ ] Rank percentile (if available)
* [ ] Activity consistency (heatmap)
* [ ] Streak behavior
* [ ] Recent activity drop/spike
* [ ] Contest participation

Do NOT judge volume alone.

---

## 1C — Professional Credibility Signals

From LinkedIn + Resume:

* [ ] Timeline consistency across platforms
* [ ] Company existence verification
* [ ] Job title inflation check
* [ ] Skills match GitHub languages?
* [ ] Career progression logic
* [ ] Education legitimacy
* [ ] Resume metrics (tag as CLAIMED)

Mark each claim:

* VERIFIED
* PLAUSIBLE
* CLAIMED

---

## 1D — Execution & Consistency Signals

Across platforms:

* [ ] Long-term engagement (>12 months?)
* [ ] Learning pattern visible?
* [ ] Skill evolution visible?
* [ ] Projects improving over time?
* [ ] Activity completely stagnant?
* [ ] Sudden cramming pattern?

Still no scoring.

---

# STAGE 2 — DOMAIN MAPPING

Now convert signals into skill domains.

This is where interpretation begins.

---

## Domain 1 — Engineering & Development

Ask:

* Can this person build production-grade systems?
* Is architecture visible?
* Is code ownership visible?
* Is this tutorial-level or production-level work?

Classify:

* [ ] Foundational
* [ ] Production-capable
* [ ] Architecture-aware
* [ ] Advanced system-level

Write:

Engineering maturity statement (2–3 lines).

---

## Domain 2 — Problem Solving

Ask:

* Interview-ready?
* Competitive programmer?
* Casual learner?
* Outdated skills?

Classify:

* [ ] Beginner DSA
* [ ] Interview-prep ready
* [ ] Strong algorithmic depth
* [ ] Contest-grade

Write:

Problem-solving maturity statement.

---

## Domain 3 — Professional Credibility

Ask:

* Are claims aligned with evidence?
* Any exaggeration?
* Is role positioning realistic?
* Any trust gaps?

Classify:

* [ ] High alignment
* [ ] Minor claim inflation
* [ ] Evidence gap
* [ ] Credibility risk

Write:

Credibility assessment statement.

---

## Domain 4 — Execution & Consistency

Ask:

* Is this disciplined effort?
* Short-term spike?
* Passive profile?
* Growth-oriented?

Classify:

* [ ] High consistency
* [ ] Moderate engagement
* [ ] Irregular effort
* [ ] Concerning inactivity

Write:

Execution behavior statement.

---

# STAGE 3 — CROSS-DOMAIN CORRELATION

Now connect domains.

This is critical.

Check:

* [ ] Strong engineering but weak DSA?
* [ ] Strong DSA but no production?
* [ ] Strong resume but weak public evidence?
* [ ] High activity but shallow depth?

This creates:

Capability Pattern.

Write 1 paragraph describing the overall pattern.

---

# STAGE 4 — BENCHMARK POSITIONING

Answer:

Compared to similar experience developers:

* Engineering: Below / Average / Above
* Problem Solving: Below / Average / Above
* Credibility: Weak / Stable / Strong
* Execution: Weak / Moderate / Strong

Do NOT inflate.

If unsure:
state limitation.

---

# STAGE 5 — CAPABILITY IDENTITY LINE

Must generate:

One precise sentence.

Structure:

[Primary role] + [maturity level] + [strength bias] + [risk note if needed]

Example:

“Backend-focused engineer with production fintech exposure and moderate algorithmic depth, showing strong execution discipline.”

This becomes identity anchor.

---

# STAGE 6 — SCORE GENERATION

Now score domains individually.

Weight suggestion (can evolve):

* Engineering → 35%
* Problem Solving → 25%
* Professional Credibility → 20%
* Execution → 20%

Checklist:

* [ ] Each score justified with data
* [ ] Benchmarked
* [ ] Not influenced by resume hype
* [ ] Penalized only for real gaps

Generate:

Overall Credibility Score (X/10)

---

# STAGE 7 — RISK & SIGNAL FLAGS

List clearly:

Green Signals:

* [ ] e.g., consistent 2-year activity
* [ ] verified fintech exposure
* [ ] architecture-level repos

Yellow Signals:

* [ ] declining LC activity
* [ ] limited OSS
* [ ] private repos

Red Signals:

* [ ] timeline mismatch
* [ ] bulk commit pattern
* [ ] unverifiable inflated claims

Be factual.

Never dramatic.

---

# STAGE 8 — INTELLIGENCE CORE COMPLETION CHECK

Before moving to derived outputs:

Confirm:

* [ ] All 4 domains interpreted
* [ ] Cross-domain pattern written
* [ ] Capability identity created
* [ ] Scores justified
* [ ] Signals flagged
* [ ] Claims tagged correctly
* [ ] No assumption statements

If YES → Intelligence Core is complete.

---

# STAGE 9 — DERIVED OUTPUT PREP

From Intelligence Core:

Generate:

### Developer Insight View

Must include:

* Role clarity
* Growth levers
* 30–60 day improvement focus
* Strength reinforcement
* Positioning advice

### Recruiter Insight View

Must include:

* Screening clarity
* Verified signals summary
* Interview depth indicator
* Risk awareness
* Hiring confidence band

These must NOT contradict the Intelligence Core.

---

# FINAL SELF-TEST

Ask yourself:

If platforms disappeared tomorrow…

Can I clearly state:

* What this person can build?
* How they solve problems?
* Whether they are reliable?
* What level they belong to?

If YES → report is strong.

If NO → revisit domain mapping.
